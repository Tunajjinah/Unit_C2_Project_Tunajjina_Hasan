      <h1>Text editors</h1>
<p>There are programs that help coders write code. The category is called enhanced text editors. These are programs that aid coders in writing code by doing things like highlighting tags and components in different colors, auto-completing or auto-formatting tags, etc.
</p>
<p>A very useful text editor is W3C Validator. In the web there are very good markup validation services but w3c validation is one of the best. </p>
<p>You can copy and paste your code in the w3c validator text box and it points out the errors you made and helps you fix them. </p>
