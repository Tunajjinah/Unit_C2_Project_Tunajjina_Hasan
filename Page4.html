    <p>However if you want to create a line break you can use the &lt;br&gt; tag. </p>
    <h4>Lorem Ipsum Text</h4>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum was invented well in advance of computers in order for book designers to layout their projects prior to receiving the actual text from writers. Web designers currently utilize it for creating page mockups.</p>
<h4>Horizontal Rule and Preformatted text</h4>
<p>If you want to create a line between blocks of text, use the &lt;hr&gt; element. hr is an empty tag. If you want to preserve multiple spaces or line breaks for text like in poems, you can use the preformatted text &lt;pre&gt; tag. pre is a block-level element.</p>
