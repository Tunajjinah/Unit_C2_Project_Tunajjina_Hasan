      <h1>File path</h1>
      <p>A File Path is the route you dictate to the computer in order to find a file.
      </p>
      <h4>What is a relative file path?</h4>
      <p>A relativefile path is when the file starts from the location of the file we are linking from and point to other points in the same same folder or other folder. Also the location of the pointing file is <b>always relevent</b> to the file we are linking from.</p>
     <h4>What is a absolute file path?</h4>
     <p>A absolute file path means the file path always starts from the root element or root folder and includes all the folder list to locate the file.</p>
      <h4>Absolute and relative path</h4>
      <p>It is best to use absolute paths when referring to files that exist outside of your current computer.
        It is often best to use relative paths when you are referring to files that are on your current computer or server. This way, if the folder that contains the files is moved, the links between files does not break. Users that access the file remotely also have little problem linking the files.
        </p>
        <h4>Key things to remember:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>"./" means current folder. You can use this to specify the relative file path and the file you want to link to is in the same folder with the file you want to link from</li> 
       <li>"../" means go one level up from the current folder. You can use this to specify the relative file path and the file you want to link to is in one level up parent folder of the current folder. </li>
        <li>"../../" means go two levels up from the current folder. You can use this to specify the relative file path when the file you want to link is in the two levels of parent folder of the current folder.</li>
      </ul>
