      <p>Several characters are considered reserved for use by HTML. Other characters are difficult to reproduce on the keyboard, or are things like emojis that can't be produced by the keyboard without a special app.</p>
<p>For example the start tag doesnt show in a original html code so you have to use "&lt" with a ";" after the t. And if you want the end tag to be visible in html you have to use "&" and "gt;". </p>
   <p>(number method): & + # + Unicode number + ;
    Example: &lt; becomes & #60;</p>
